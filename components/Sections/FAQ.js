            We don't expect everyone to follow the dress code to the T, but we
            would like to keep the event as a classy affair. It's a great chance
            for everyone to dress up for the evening.

        answer={
          <>
            We're starting the ceremony at 4:00pm and ask that guests arrive
            fifteen minutes early so that everyone is settled, and we can begin
            on time.

            Yes, there will be many kids in attendance. If you have little ones
            that would like to attend, all we ask is that you include that in
            your RSVP so that we can get an accurate count. Please no +1s for
            the kids.

            We are providing an open bar with beer, wine, and cocktail
            selections. There will be a cocktail hour for an hour after the
            ceremony and before the reception while the wedding party takes
            photos nearby.
